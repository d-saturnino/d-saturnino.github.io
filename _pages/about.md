I'm a portuguese research engineer in academia in France.  
My research subjects are geomagnetism and inverse problems in geophysics.  
I love scientific programing, data colleting and analysis.  
I also like books, puzzles, and the sound of rain.

Skills: C, Python, Fortran, Matlab
        Linux environment, Shell
        Git
        Inkscape, LibreOffice
