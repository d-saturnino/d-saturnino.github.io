Hello there!
I'm diana saturnino, just a young woman trying to fly in the world. 
I work on research, more specifically on the topic of Earth's magnetism. I've aways been a fan of geophysics. I love to program, treat data and find what is hidding in it. I also like books, puzzles, and the sound of rain.

This site is supposed to be an ensemble of experiences and random blogs.
