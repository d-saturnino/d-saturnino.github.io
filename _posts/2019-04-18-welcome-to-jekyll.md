Today I obtained the course certificate of [Machine Learning](https://coursera.org/share/028a7af02a26042b748be4eef38439fe),  an online non-credit course authorized by Stanford University and offered through Coursera with professor Andrew Ng.    
I'm very happy for this as it is my first course completed online and also because it allowed me to learn a lot of new things as well as opened my mind to the world of things I can still learn.
