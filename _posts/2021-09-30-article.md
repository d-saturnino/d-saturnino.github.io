An article of the work my collegues and I submited during the summer as just been published. I'm very happy that our hard work finally paid off., after many tests, teories and calculations, without mentioning the difficulty to find a journal and bein acepted.   
The artice can be found here: <https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021JA029579> .   
It is a study on the signatures of external currents on the measured magnetic field at satellite altitude.
